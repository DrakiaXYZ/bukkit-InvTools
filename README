 Description
=============
A basic tool invincibility plugin for Bukkit. Ported from my hMod plugin.

Ability to toggle invincibility on a per-item basis.
Tools are only repaired when their damage reaches a certain threshold.

 Config
=============
Config info is stored in YAML file plugins/InvTools/config.yml
Variables:
	groupPolicy - Not Implemented in Bukkit version.
	Tools - A comma-separated list of item IDs that should be invincible.
	RepairPoint - An integer that sets the minimum damage an item is repaired at.
	
Defaults:
	groupPolicy - False
	Tools - 277,278,279,293 (Diamond tools)
	RepairPoint - 30 (Wood breaks at 33)

=============
 Permissions
=============
I added support for the Permissions plugin, if it's not enabled then everybody
gets access to invincible tools. Give any groups you want access the:
'invtools.allow'
permissions to enable for specific groups.
